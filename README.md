# Voice Wallet A Google Assistant (Hey Google) AI Defi Wallet

Voice Wallet is a cross chain voice wallet proof of concept. The Voice Wallet that can be operated by voice anytime and anywhere via any device that has a google assistant, including the millions of mobile phones out there.

It is working albeit very rough and can currently check the balance accross a wallet address (currently one of my own)

There are over 100 million Google Assistant (Hey Google) enabled devices out there and many times more users per device.  The vision is to onboard as many Google Assistant voice users out there to the web3 world effortlessly.

Voice brings the ease and convenience of accessing information the web3 and defi world. Upon further development, you can say things below to Voice Wallet:

- "Hey Google, ask Voice Wallet to check my wallet balance"

Given more time, hoping to finish implementing:
- "Notify me when a new transaction occurs on my wallet"
- "What is the total value of my tokens in US dollars?"
- "Read me my last transaction"
and many more.

You can use this at home or even on the move with a Google enabled headphones, etc!

Also hoping to in the future allow voice personalisation i.e. only respond if the voice is recognized, e.g. if you ask for a balance, your balance will be spoken and if your partner ask, it will be their balance. `If anyone else ask, then they will not get a balance.

Some fun things that will be also built
"Hey Google, Ask Voice Wallet to move my USDC from Binance to Solana"

## Running the code

Unfortunately, the process of submission and approval on Google side takes time and can be weeks even for defi/finance voice skills so the best I can do is to provide this source code here where you can just compile and deploy on your Google Actions accounts. I will provide a proper build instructions in the future. Alternatively f you want to try, you can give me your google account email I might be able to add you as a beta tester. In any case reach out to me if you want.

## Youtube Recording

There is actually a video recording of more than 4 hours of me building this voice app from scratch. If you want to painstakingly watch it, I will add it as soon as possible under VIDEO.md file. Unfortunately i can't provide it now as I am short of time.
